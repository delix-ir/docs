# Managing Files

Both of OCR and PDF content extraction services require some files to be used. However, input files are being managed separately than the services.

This feature helps you to request multiple services on one or many files without uploading them in every request.

## Storage Limitations

You can have multiple files available at a time however, your storage have some limitations:

|  | Limitation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Max. stored file count | 30 |
| Max. total size of store | 100 MB |

You can send file deleting requests whenever you don't need the uploaded files anymore.

Files will be available for 24 hours and after that, will be deleted from your storage automatically.
